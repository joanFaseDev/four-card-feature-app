## About myself

Hi! I'm Jordan, an aspiring frontend developer. This means that this project is probably not the best learning material. That being said, i'll try to explain my process to the best of my abilities (which is kinda limited considering the fact that english isn't my first language, by the way my apologies for any mispellings or grammatical errors) in case someone happen to read this file. Worst case scenario, i can always come back to this project later and have fun at how bad i was back then!

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Analysis

- This project is made out of a few elements:

  - A _main_ element to act as a global container.
  - A head title, a _h1_ element will do. Inside the _h1_, we'll need a span for some strings have a bigger font-weight.
  - A paragraph _p_, probably using the default font size.
  - Four cards

- Each card have a different content but their layout is the same:

  - We can use a _section_ element as a card container.
  - Each card have a title which is good because _section_ element need to have one. Here, a _h2_ would do.
  - Then a paragraph _p_ and a svg image/icon located in the bottom right corner. We can use an _img_ element here.
  - Between the _section_ and its content, we'll add a _div_ element with a width in percentage. That way, we won't have to _padding_ for the cards.
  - Each card have a border top of a different color. Border style seems to be _inset_.
  - Also, each card use a light _box shadow_ and _border-radius_.

- Because the card's layout is the same, we can reuse a lot of code by using appropriate classes.

- The global layout for the mobile design is simple enough, one column for five rows. As for the desktop design, it's probably three columns for five rows. We'll use CSS Grid for the global layout and maybe Flexbox for the layout's cards.

- As usual, we'll start with the mobile design for it is easier to add complexity to a design than to remove from it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
